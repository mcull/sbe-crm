# Opinionated Course/Product Management System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Chaotic manual product creation with inconsistent naming, scattered pricing, and manual Stripe sync
**After:** Template-driven automatic product generation with intelligent naming and consistent pricing

## 🏗 System Architecture

```
Templates (few, configured by Phillip)
├── Course Templates: WSET Level 1-4 with pricing/capacity/settings
├── Exam Templates: Spot exams and retakes
├── Product Templates: Tasting kits, materials, vouchers

↓ When Phillip schedules sessions ↓

Products (auto-generated, never manually created)
├── Intelligent naming: "WSET Level 2 - Jan 15, 2024 (Downtown)"
├── Smart pricing: Base + early bird calculated from templates
├── Rich metadata: Session details, WSET level, instructor, etc.
├── Auto Stripe sync: Ready for e-commerce with proper setup
```

## 🗃 Database Schema (Ready to Apply)

The enhanced schema is in `supabase/migrations/20241217000003_enhanced_product_model.sql`:

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ **Complete:**
- Database schema designed and ready
- Admin interfaces built and functional
- Backend actions implemented
- Demo interface showing the workflow
- Auto-generation triggers and functions
- Template management system

### ⚠️ **Needs Database Migration:**
The migration file is ready but needs to be applied manually through Supabase dashboard due to API limitations.

**Steps to complete setup:**
1. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20241217000003_enhanced_product_model.sql`
2. Run in Supabase SQL editor
3. System will be fully operational

## 📋 Phillip's Workflow (After Migration)

### 1. **Configure Templates** (One-time setup)
- Set WSET level pricing and capacity
- Configure early bird discounts
- Enable auto-generation settings
- Set up exam and product templates

### 2. **Schedule Sessions** (Daily operation)
- Select course template (WSET Level 1-4)
- Enter session details (date, location, instructor)
- **System automatically creates:**
  - Product with intelligent name
  - Consistent pricing from template
  - Early bird deadlines
  - Stripe-ready metadata

### 3. **Monitor Results** (Dashboard)
- View auto-generated products
- Track template usage statistics
- Manage pricing across all products
- Monitor Stripe sync status

## 🔧 Demo Available Now
