Sugar, Acid, PTC Strip, MSG, thorough instructions, and a tasting mat are all included. When you receive your kit, open it up, and follow the instructions included, as you cue up the corresponding videos to guide you through these fun activities.</p><p class="""" style=""white-space:pre-wrap;"">The videos will guide you through the exercises as if you were taking the in-person versions of our classes.
